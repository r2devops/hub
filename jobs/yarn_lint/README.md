## Objective

This job will run a predefined `lint` script in your `package.json` which will check your code quality.


## How to use it

1. Make sure that your project has
   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains the required `lint` command in the `scripts` object
2. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
4. You are done, the job is ready to use ! ðŸ˜‰


## Variables

!!! note
    All paths defined in variables are relative and start from the root of your
    repository.

| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | Relative path to the directory containing `package.json` (**see warning below**)  | ` ` |
| `YARN_INSTALL_OPTIONS` | Additional options for `yarn install` | ` ` |
| `YARN_LINT_OPTIONS` | Additional options for `yarn run lint` | ` ` |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | The default tag for the docker image | `20-buster`  |

!!! warning
    In the case you are updating `PROJECT_ROOT` and you want to have a properly working cache,
    consider making this variable a global variable in the root of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Learn how
    easy it is [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#create-a-custom-cicd-variable-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file).


## Cache

This job creates a global cache configuration. Regarding the configuration
applied, cache behavior is the following:

* Each branch has its own version
* Cached directory is `$PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules`
* If `package.json` or `yarn.json` is edited, the cache is updated

documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/index.html).
