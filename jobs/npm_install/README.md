## Objective

This job installs `npm` dependencies listed in your `package-lock.json` and exposes
`node_modules` as cache to other jobs of your pipeline. It allows you to run
`npm install` only once in your pipeline.


## How to use it

!!! info
    If you don't have `package-lock.json`, the job will look for `package.json` and use it instead

1. Ensure that your project have
   [`package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-lock-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains the requirements
2. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
4. Well done, your job is ready to be used ! ðŸ˜€


!!! info
    On Gitlab, this job will be run in the default first stage of your
    pipeline: [`.pre`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#pre-and-post)

!!! warning
    For this reason, using only this job in your pipeline will not trigger a pipeline in Gitlab.
    You have to add additional jobs.

## Variables


| Name | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | Relative path to the directory containing `package.json` (**see warning below**)  | ` ` |
| `NPM_INSTALL_OPTIONS` | Additional options for `npm install` | ` ` |
| `NPM_USE_CI` | Enable usage of `npm ci` instead of classic `npm install` | `true` |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | The default tag for the docker image | `20-buster`  |

!!! warning
    In the case you are updating `PROJECT_ROOT` and you want to have a properly working cache,
    consider making this variable a global variable in the root of your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Learn how
    easy it is [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#create-a-custom-cicd-variable-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file).

## Cache

This job creates a global cache configuration. Regarding the configuration
applied, cache behavior is the following:

* Each branch has its own version
* Cached directory is `$PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules`
* If `package.json` or `package-lock.json` is edited, the cache is updated

documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/index.html).
