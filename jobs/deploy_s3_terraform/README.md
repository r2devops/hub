## Objective

!!! error "This job is deprecated 🚨"
    This job has been moved to [`s3_deploy`](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/s3_deploy) and must be use instead.
    The job is no more maintained and is now deprecated. Despites it still exists to keep working on pipelines.

Deploy a static website on a S3 bucket provided by a Terraform state. It is a fusion of [gitlab-terraform_apply](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/gitlab-terraform_apply) and  [aws_s3_sync](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/aws_s3_sync).

## How to use it

1. Make sure that you have your terraform files in your repository and update the `TF_ROOT` variable to point to the folder containing your terraform files.
1. Set your Terraform secret variables in the `Gitlab CI/CD` variables section of your project (see the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html){:target="_blank"} about variables) .

    !!! info "Terraform HTTP Backend"
    By default, this job will run using the `http` backend, so you have to follow the [instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.html#initialize-a-terraform-state-as-a-backend-by-using-gitlab-cicd){:target="_blank"} to configure it in advance.
1. Set your AWS credentials variables in the `Gitlab CI/CD` variables section of your project (see the [S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html){:target="_blank"} about credentials) .

    ??? summary "Need a custom Endpoint ⚓ ?"
      Just type your custom url in the variable `AWS_ENDPOINT`.
      For example, you can find the custom endpoint url for Scaleway [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/){:target="_blank"}.

    ??? info "Set up a bucket policy 👮"
      Depending on your Cloud provider, you might need to set up a bucket policy. You can specify it via the variable `AWS_BUCKET_POLICY_FILE`. For example, you can find some documentation for bucket policy for Amazon S3 [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html){:target="_blank"}.
1. Make sure to fulfill all mandatory variables. See the **Variables** section 👇
1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) 👉 check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work ! 😀

## Variables

!!! warning
    Some variable are required to let the job work. Many of them are *secrets*, they should be define in the `CI/CD > Variables` section in [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project) to avoid exposing them in clear in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. This is **HIGHLY** recommended for sensitive credential variables such as cloud providers tokens and passwords.

## Configuring Terraform

To works well with Terraform, variable should be defined in the `CI/CD > Variables` section in [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project).


## Here is an working example of deploying a website on a S3 bucket hosted by Scaleway

Structure :
```sh
build/ #Directory where the website is built
terraform/
├─ main.tf
├─ backend.tf
├─ variables.tf

```

`main.tf`
```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    scaleway = {
      source = "scaleway/scaleway"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 0.13"
}

provider "scaleway" {
  access_key = var.SCW_ACCESS_KEY
  secret_key = var.SCW_SECRET_KEY
  project_id = var.project_id
  region     = var.region
}

resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "bucket_website" {
  name = var.bucket_name
  acl  = var.acl
  versioning {
    enabled = var.enabled_bucket_versioning
  }
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }

}

```

Concerning the variables, you can find the [scaleway](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#scaleway-variables) variables in the [GitLab CI/CD > Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) section.

![CI/CD variables on GitLab](./screenshots/ci_cd_variables.png)

And here is the file where there are defined `variables.tf` :

```tf
variable "SCW_ACCESS_KEY" {
  type        = string
  description = "Scaleway secret access key"
}

variable "SCW_SECRET_KEY" {
  type        = string
  description = "Scaleway secret id key"
}

variable "project_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "Scaleway Organization or project id used"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name of the s3 bucket"
}

variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "Region where is hosted the bucket"
}

variable "enabled_bucket_versioning" {
  type        = bool
  default     = false
  description = "Should the bucket be versioned"
}

variable "acl" {
  type        = string
  description = "Bucket visibility"
}

```
Finally here is the content of the `backend.tf` file :

```tf
terraform {
  # Gitlab managed terraform state
  backend "http" {
  }
}

```
