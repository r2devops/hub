## Objective

[Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/wiki/Scanning){:target="_blank"} is a tool made to detect hardcoded
secrets like passwords, api keys and tokens in git repository. As it written in go, it is much faster than most of the
[alternatives](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/wiki/Comparison-with-other-tools){:target="_blank"}.

## How to use it

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
2. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

## Allowing Failure

If you want for this job not to fail upon discovering a secret in the commits of the repository, you can do that by
adding this to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
gitleaks:
  allow_failure: true
```
