## Objective

Deploy a static website using GitLab Pages.  
This job can be used to deploy documentation, a static website or a Single Page Application.  

## How to use it

!!! note "Requirements"
    You have to use a job which build your website in a previous stage. *We recommend you to use a jobs available on the hub in `build`*. They build a static site of your application and publish it as artifact in `website_build/` folder .  
    üìó To generate documentation you could use [mkdocs](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/mkdocs)  
    üï∏Ô∏è To deploy a SPA, you could use [npm_build](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/npm_build) or [yarn_build](https://r2devops.io/_/r2devops-bot/yarn_build). 
      
!!! info "How to deploy a SPA ?"
    In case, you want to deploy a SPA, you will only have one root file `index.html`, with your own rooting system. **Therefore, it's important that all requests are rewritten to this file.**  
    To do so create a `_redirects` file inside the root of your repository and set the variable `PAGES_REDIRECTION_FILE` to `_redirects`. Finally add this content inside the file :  
    `/* /index.html 200`   
    For more information, check the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/redirects.html#rewrite-all-requests-to-a-root-indexhtml).

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
2. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) üëâ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
3. Well done, your job is ready to work ! üòÄ
