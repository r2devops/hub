## Objective

This job allows you to build your project using a script (`build` by default)
from your `package.json` file.

## How to use it

1. Ensure that your project have
   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains the script required to build (`build` by default)
1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

| `NPM_INSTALL_OPTIONS` | Additional options for `npm install` | ` ` |
| `NPM_BUILD_SCRIPT_NAME` | The build script in the `package.json` that you want to run | `build` |
| `NPM_BUILD_OPTIONS` | Options passed to your build script | ` ` |
| `NPM_BUILD_OUTPUT_FOLDER` | Path to the output produced by the `npm` build script used (path relative from the `PROJECT_ROOT`) | `build` |
| `PAGES_FOLDER` | Path where to copy the output to be exposed for deployment on [pages](https://r2devops.io/_/gitlab/r2devops/hub/pages) (path relative from the root of the repository) | `./website_build` |
| `IMAGE_TAG` | The default tag for the docker image | `20-buster`  |

## Example to deploy on pages

Following example of `.gitlab-ci.yml` file describes how to enable Gitlab pages
deployment using this job:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

include:
  - remote: 'https://api.r2devops.io/job/r/gitlab/r2devops/hub/pages'
  - remote: 'https://api.r2devops.io/job/r/gitlab/r2devops/hub/npm_build'
```

## Artifact

When the job is successful, the build result is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed
    as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `npm build` in merge requests.  Exposition of artifact currently works only
    if you keep `NPM_BUILD_OUTPUT_FOLDER` default value because of [this issue
    from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
