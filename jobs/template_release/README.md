## Objective

Retrieve all templates from a repository and create GitLab release (and git tag) for each versions listed in `CHANGELOG.md`

## How to use it

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed
   version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
2. The job can be run "out of the box". If you need to personalize its
   behavior, check the **variables section**
3. Well done, your job is ready to work and will be execute on your main branch ! üòÄ


## Jobs files

**Here is an example of a job metadata file:**

```yaml
files: # mandatory
    template: ./jobs/docker_build/docker_build.yml  # mandatory
    documentation: ./jobs/docker_build/README.md # optional
    changelog: ./jobs/docker_build/CHANGELOG.md # mandatory
data: # optional
    description: "A ready-to-use docker job to push the image of your project repository to the GitLab registry"
    public: false
    deprecated: false
    license: MIT
    icon: üê≥
    labels:
      - Lint
      - Security
      - Test

```
A job metadata file is required to create the releases. It should follow these rules:

- The files must be named with an extension defined by the variable `METADATA_FILE_EXTENSION`. By default, it is set to `.r2.yml`
- The entries in this file must have relative paths linking the job metadata file to the job template, documentation, and changelog files.
- The changelog path must be defined and must be a valid file.
- The template path must be defined and must be a valid file.

For more information about job templates, check the [documentation](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/manage-templates/#template-r2-file).


**Here's the example structure of a job template folder:**
```
docker_build/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker_build.yml (containing a job named docker_build )
```

A `CHANGELOG.md` file as explained in the previous example, is required to create releases. It should follow these rules:

- The structure of the `CHANGELOG.md` is based on [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) structure.
- You could also checkout the [R2Devops documentation](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/manage-templates/#template-changelog) about it

**Here's an example of a `CHANGELOG.md`:**
```
