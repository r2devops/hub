## Objective

Run a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in a docker image
using [Zaproxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/), the OWASP web app scanner.

## How to use it

!!! warning
    Zaproxy is mainly used to scan web applications and web frontend. You can use the tool to try and discover
    API vulnerabilities, but this job is focused on a quick scan for a frontend service (with or without authentication)

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
1. Choose a target

    !!! note
        This job can be run on external services or by running a container
        instance of your software. **You need to choose between two following
        options**.

    - Option 1: external service

    Add the IP address or the domain name of the service in `ZAP_TARGET`
    (see [jobs customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization))

    - Option 2: container instance

    Add the target container instance as a service (see
    [Container instance as Service]((https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#use-a-template))/#container-instance-as-service))
    and set `ZAP_TARGET` as the name of your container.

1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

## Artifacts

Zaproxy result is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `Zaproxy report` in merge requests.
    Exposition of artifact currently works only if you keep `ZAP_REPORT_FILE`
    and `ZAP_REPORT_FORMAT` default value because of [this issue from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
