## Jobs files

**Here's the example structure of a job template folder:**
```
docker_build/
  â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md
  â””â”€â”€ docker_build.yaml (containing a job named docker_build )
```

A `CHANGELOG.md` is required to create the releases
- The structure of the `CHANGELOG.md` is based on [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) structure.
- You could also checkout the [R2Devops documentation](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/manage-templates/#template-versioning) about it

**Here's an example of a `CHANGELOG.md`:**
