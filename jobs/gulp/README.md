## Example of `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

If you want to [change the default stage]((https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#use-a-template))/#use-custom-stage), or [customize your job]((https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#use-a-template))/#global) have a look on the example below üëáüèΩ

```yaml
stages:
  - prepare-frontend

include:
  - remote: 'https://api.r2devops.io/job/r/gitlab/r2devops/hub/gulp'

gulp:
  stage: prepare-frontend
  variables:
    PROJECT_ROOT: "frontend/"
    GULP_TASKS: "generate-fonts; minify-css; minify-js; "
    GULPFILE_PATH: "config/gulpfile.js"
```

| `INSTALL_OPTIONS` | Additional options for the installation of `PACKAGE_MANAGER` <br/> *Ex: For npm `--save-dev`*  | ` ` |

## Artifacts

When the job is successful, Gulp result is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `gulp artifact` in merge requests.
    Exposition of artifact currently works only if you keep `PROJECT_ROOT` and
    `GULP_OUTPUT_FOLDER` default value because of [this issue from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
