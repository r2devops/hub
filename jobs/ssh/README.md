## Objective

Run a SSH command on a remote host.

## How to use it

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the **quick use**). You can specify [a fixed version](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#versioning) instead of `latest`.
1. Set the secret variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` as CI/CD variables (it can be file
   or variable type) in [your Gitlab
   project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project){:target="_blank"}
   if you need encrypted variables
1. Set the variables `SSH_USER`, `TARGET_HOST` and `SHELL_COMMAND` by
   overriding the job or as Gitlab CI/CD variables. See **variables
   section**
2. If you need to customize other part of the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰
   check the [jobs customization](https://docs.r2devops.io/get-started/use-templates/#job-templates-customization)
3. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

## Example of `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/ssh.yml'

ssh:
  variables:
    SSH_USER: r2devops
    TARGET_HOST: r2devops.io
    SHELL_COMMAND: echo "Hello world !"
```

## Variables

!!! info
    All variables can be set using [Gitlab CI/CD
    variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project) to
    avoid exposing them in clear in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. This is recommended
    for sensible parameters as `SSH_USER` or `TARGET_HOST` and it's **HIGHLY**
    recommended for secret variable `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

| Name | Description | Mandatory | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ------- |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private SSH key to login on the `TARGET_HOST` server | yes | ` `
| `SSH_USER` | User on the target host | yes | ` `
| `TARGET_HOST` | Domain name or IP address of the target host | yes | ` `
| `SHELL_COMMAND` | Shell command to run on `TARGET_HOST` | yes | ` `
| `SSH_PORT` | SSH server port on target host | no | `22`
| `SSH_OUTPUT_FILE` | File that will be used to store SSH output | no | `ssh_output.txt `
| `IMAGE_TAG` | The default tag for the docker image | yes | `3`

## Artifacts

* If remote command success: the job success with the output as artifact
* If remote command fails: the job fails with the output as artifact

Command output is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed
    as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `SSH output` in merge requests.  Exposition of artifact currently works
    only if you keep `SSH_OUTPUT_FILE` default value because of [this issue
    from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
